# IOT Enabled Crop Recommendation and Yield Prediction
</br>
Horticulture is the subdivision of agriculture sector which deals with the
cultivation of fruits, vegetables, flowers, medicinal plants and plantation crops
namely tea, coffee, pepper etc. The growth of these crops depend on the soil
conditions like soil type, soil pH, NPK values, rainfall, humidity etc. The aim of
this project is to develop a crop recommendation and yield prediction system by
considering the above mentioned factors and implement the proposed system in
real-time using IoT technology.
The investigation is restricted to the database of TN State which consists of
around 20 crops. The 7 in 1 Integrated Soil Sensor is used to collect the soil
details, upon which a suitable crop is recommended and an appropriate yield is
calculated. A simple mobile application is designed using React Native, which
can be used to interact with the system and obtain real-time recommendations.
